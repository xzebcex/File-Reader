# **File Reader**
This Python script reads a file and displays its contents on the console. The script uses the 'pathlib' module to create a Path object that points to the file to be read.

## Prerequisites
This script can only be run if Python3 is installed on your machine.

## How to Use
This script should be saved on your computer.
The path variable in the script should be modified to point to the file you wish to read.
For instance, replacing the empty string in the path to your file with Path = Path('path/to/your/file.txt').
Use the Python script environment of your choice to run the script. The contents of the file will be shown on the terminal.

## Example
Assume you have a file in the same directory as this script named example.txt. To read the contents of example.txt, change the path variable in the script as follows:
path = ('example.txt')
Save your changes to the script and run it. The contents of example.txt will be shown to the console.

## Note
The whole path must be contained in the path variable if the file to be read is not in the same directory as this script.
